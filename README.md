# Horsepower Estimator

Simple Excel model to calculate the expected power output from an internal combustion engine.

Inputs accounted for include engine displacement, compression ratio and engine speed.

## Use Cases

Some benefits:

- Understand if potential is being left on the table. [Example](https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/41581/675)
- Validate power claims. See [this Mechanics.SE Q&A](https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/43581/675)
- Establish engine design targets

## Future Work

This would be ideal to roll up along with other engine sizing calculation routines to publish as a web service or Docker container. Maybe F# or Raku?

It would also benefit tremendously from robust engineering units management.
